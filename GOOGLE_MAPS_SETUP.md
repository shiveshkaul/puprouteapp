# PupRoute - Advanced Walk Tracking Setup

## 🗺️ Google Maps Integration

Your PupRoute app includes advanced walk tracking with real Google Maps integration. Currently, it's running in **demo mode** with interactive mock maps.

### To Enable Real Google Maps:

1. **Get a Google Maps API Key:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing
   - Enable these APIs:
     - Maps JavaScript API
     - Places API  
     - Geocoding API
     - Directions API
     - Street View Static API
     - Roads API (for route snapping)
     - Air Quality API (optional)

2. **Configure Your API Key:**
   - Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` (if it doesn't exist)
   - Add your API key:
     ```
     VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     ```

3. **Restart Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
